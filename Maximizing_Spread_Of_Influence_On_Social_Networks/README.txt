In this project we explore the results presented by Kempe et al. in inMaximizing the Spread of Influence
through a Social Network. We evaluate the experimental aspects of the paper on the dataset used by Kempe
et al. We also evaluate their propositions on an additional dataset and find that their results are qualitatively
consistent.
